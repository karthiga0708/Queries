## Where did we use session id?
  - Session id is also known as session tokens, It is piece of code (unique identifier) that a web server assigns a user when they login. A session is a finite period of interaction between a client and server.
  - Sessions and session IDs provide a mechanism for requests together, making it easier to carry out tasks such as filling out multipage forms or tracking items in an online-shopping cart.
  - Web servers that issue session IDs use various methods to persist the IDs throughout the life of the session.
  - The most common approach is to store the session ID as a cookie on the user's browser.
  - A cookie is a small amount of data that contains information about the user, session, environment or user's activity.
  - A cookie that holds a session ID is typically deleted after the session has been terminated
