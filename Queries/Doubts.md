## Where did we use session id?
  - Session id is also known as session tokens, It is piece of code (unique identifier) that a web server assigns a user when they login. A session is a finite period of interaction between a client and server.
  - Sessions and session IDs provide a mechanism for requests together, making it easier to carry out tasks such as filling out multipage forms or tracking items in an online-shopping cart.
  - Web servers that issue session IDs use various methods to persist the IDs throughout the life of the session.
  - The most common approach is to store the session ID as a cookie on the user's browser.
  - A cookie is a small amount of data that contains information about the user, session, environment or user's activity.
  - A cookie that holds a session ID is typically deleted after the session has been terminated

## What is poor management?
  - Poor session management refers to the mishandling of user sessions in a web application, which can lead to various security vulnerabilities and usability issues.
  - A user session typically starts when a user logs into a web application and ends when they log out.
  - Effective session management ensures that the user's session is secure and properly tracked.

## same-origin policy in detail?(best practices, sytax, 5wh)
      - The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a security measure implemented in web browsers to prevent malicious scripts on one page from accessing data on another page unless they share the same origin. 
      This policy helps protect the confidentiality and integrity of information by restricting how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.
